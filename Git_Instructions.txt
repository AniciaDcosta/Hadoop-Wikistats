# To set up itasca to be able to push to github:

# First change your git configuration to have your itasca account to use your github user name and email
$ git config --global user.email christensen.t.eric@gmail.com
$ git config --global user.name EricChristensen

# Navigate into your .ssh directory from your home directory
$ cd ~/.ssh

# There are two files located in a directory called "group1" in lustre: "gitssh" and "gitssh.pub"
# the wikifile folder is also in this directory, but that's not important
# Copy "gitssh" and "gitssh.pub" into your .ssh folder
$ cp ~/../../../../lustre/group1/gitssh .
$ cp ~/../../../../lustre/group1/gitssh.pub .

# Navigate to your home directory
$ cd ~
# and then do these two commands:
$ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
$ ssh-add ~/.ssh/gitssh

#Then when you are cloning the git repository, make sure to clone ssh version
$ git clone git@github.com:EricChristensen/Hadoop-Wikistats.git

# And hopefully this takes care of things!
